Before submitting your project, it will be a good idea to go back through your report and remove these sections to make the presentation of your work as tidy as possible. First things first, you might want to double-click this Markdown cell and change the title so that it reflects your dataset and investigation.\n",

At the end of this section, describe the questions that you plan on exploring over the course of the report. Try to build your report around the analysis of at least one dependent variable and three independent variables. If you're not sure what questions to ask, then make sure you familiarize yourself with the dataset, its variables and the dataset context for ideas of what to explore.\n",

These don't have to be organized, but make sure you use enough comments to understand the purpose of each code cell. Then, after you're done with your analysis, create a duplicate notebook where you will trim the excess and organize your steps so that you have a flowing, cohesive report.\n",
